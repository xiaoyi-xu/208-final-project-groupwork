## Who are prone to heart attack?
### Group members: Jun Wei, Xiaoyi Xu, Yunhao Yang
In our project, we discovery the data set about heart attack from the World Health Organization and we get this data set from Kaggle((https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)). In our project, you can find our final report in notebook and in the report we show the analysis of the data set through some methods achieve by Python.

And in code, we will show what we have done in Python. And the name of each file will respond to the code name we run in the notebook.

3.1.py: usedata munging method and matplotlib.pyplot to do preliminary research on data set

3.2.py: use plotnine to achieve interactive visualization

3.3.py: use matplotlib.pyplot to achieve interactive visualization

4.1.1.py: use statsmodels.api to do the simple linear regression and use matplotlib.pyplot to draw diagnostic plots

4.1.2.py: use sklearn.linear_model and sklearn.metrics to compare the accuracy of logistic regression with L1 penalty and L2 penalty, and use sklearn.feature_selection to select variables

4.2.1.py: choose variables from data set and split the data into training data and test data

4.2.2.py: set classification models

4.2.3.py: calculate the accuracy score for the model and plot the confusion matrix and ROC curve.

4.2.4: conduct K fold cross validation
